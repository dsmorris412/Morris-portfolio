In parts I and II (and partially III as well), I got really caught up in the overwhelming scope of the issue (amount of waste we produce, the failings of recycling, etc.) and struggled to narrow the problem to a single narrative - let alone one that could be relayed in the span of a minute. There were many potential offshoots of the issue that I did work to rank in priority during part III of the project. 

Since the completion of part II, I made a lot of progress in terms of the fidelity of my visualizations and discovered which visualizations were best suited to tell my story. I also took the user research feedback seriously and adjusted any visualizations that were incomplete/confusing. The feedback also led me to narrow my focus and eliminate parts of the story that were more distracting than they were supporting.

Centering on my character (Kathy) and her realization of the recycling dilemma, I chose to eliminate some of the broader market-based background of recycling (e.g. the market was upended when China acted to no longer accept much of our recycling). While I had to move away from some of the context, I do think the trade-off to incorporate a character was worth it - hopefully allowing the audience to relate to 'Kathy' and her realization of the state of recycling in the U.S. This also helped me to target a broad audience of anyone who recycles. 

As a practical matter, I did struggle quite a bit with the design and layout with shorthand, infogram, etc. and can be sure that I still have a lot to learn on the appealing design side of things. However, while I am far from an expert from any of the platforms I used throughout the project, I did get exposure to a tremendous amount of resources and was able to get a sense of how many options there are in order to curate data/information and tell your story.
