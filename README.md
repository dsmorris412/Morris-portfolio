Telling Stories with Data Public Portfolio

# About me
My name is Deirdre (she/her) and I'm in the Public Policy and Management program here at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from a small town in Maryland, but have lived in Pittsburgh the last three years. I've worked in law firms up until this shift in trajectory to public policy, so I am trying to make use of every learning opportunity that I come across while in the program. 

# What I hope to learn
Data visualization is incredibly powerful in this day and age, and a tool that is used (not always well) in just about every industry. The strategies and tools will all be new to me (I'm pretty impressed by it all right now). I hope to learn how to cater a visualization to a particular audience and how to create honest visualizations that are effective in communication. I plan to narrow this down but after I graduate, I am hoping to go into the policy analysis field.
