Telling Stories with Data Public Portfolio

#About me
My name is **Deirdre** (she/her) and I'm in the Public Policy and Management program here at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from a small town in Maryland, but have lived in Pittsburgh the last three years (and love it!). I've worked in law firms up until this shift in trajectory to public policy, so I am that much more commited to the learning process and discovering where this path will lead.

#What I hope to learn
Data visualization is incredibly powerful in this day and age, and a tool that is used (not always well) in just about every industry. This will be incredibly new to me. I hope to learn how to cater a visualization to a particular audience and how to avoid common missteps.
