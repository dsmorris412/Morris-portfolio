Telling Stories with Data Public Portfolio

# About me
My name is Deirdre (she/her) and I'm in the Public Policy and Management program here at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from a small town in Maryland, but have lived in Pittsburgh the last three years. I've worked in law firms up until this shift in trajectory to public policy, so I am trying to make use of every learning opportunity that I come across while in the program. 

# What I hope to learn
Data visualization is incredibly powerful in this day and age, and a tool that is used (not always well) in just about every industry. The strategies and tools will all be new to me (I'm pretty impressed by it all right now). I hope to learn how to cater a visualization to a particular audience and how to create honest visualizations that are effective in communication. I plan to narrow this down but after I graduate, I am hoping to go into the policy analysis field.

## Written Summary
All three visualizations are quite different in how they display the data. The first graphic (the bar chart) limited the data to a single year (2018) – which made the debt-GDP ratio values more digestible in connection with each individual country, though does not incorporate any time dimension. It also presented in order of lowest to highest debt to GDP ratio, which gave the reader a sense of scope. This was important in the sense that many readers might not know what ratio might be normal or common across the world. The order of this information also suggests most people might be drawn to the highest few countries, the lowest few countries, and perhaps 1 or 2 in the middle.

The following graphic (grid lines) introduces this data on a timeline and creates a graph for each country. If the intention is to compare countries, these individual graphs make that harder to do because of the eye travel required. It also meant that the y-axis for each small graph was quite compressed (to accommodate the large range), so most of the lines looked relatively the same - most ratios didn’t *appear* to have changed dramatically during the ’95-’19 time period. That said, once appreciating the values on the axis, this visualization did allow for a better understanding of how this ratio fluctuated over time in any one particular country. 
The last graphic of my choice (stacked area chart) continues with the idea that the countries should be displayed separately if maintaining the consideration of change over time. This third graphic is definitely catered to someone who would like to look at this time-based ratio for a specific country or just a few countries. The much larger space dedicated to each country meant a greater opportunity to appreciate the actual ratios that were associated with each year for a given country. But, given the greater space for detail meant less opportunity to find general patterns across the dataset.

Why I chose this visualization: After quite a bit of experimentation, I chose the third data visualization because every visualization that included all 3 variables (countries, timeline and ratios) together seemed too crowded to discern what data connected with what country. I did really like the possibility of using a bar chart race - have the graphic adjust the ratios as the chart moves through the years, but I needed the raw data to be displayed with years as the column headers (rather than vertically) and I assumed the intention was probably to stick with the data as-is. Using the stacked area chart with a row filter on the country as I did, is catered to a reader who might want to view this ratio over time for a particular country or a handful of countries, easily toggling between a few via the dropdown. The default template adjusted both the x and y-axis based on the available data and relevant range, respectively. I found it important to set those parameters (setting the x-axis min 1995 - max 2019 and y-axis min 0 - max 260) so that the data didn't appear manipulated and you could meaningfully compare different countries without taking into consideration different scales. I chose the dark pink color scheme to communicate that this value can be concerning as it gets higher (but a red would have been overkill, I think). I can appreciate that all three visualizations highlight different information and make the decision to prioritize some data over others.
