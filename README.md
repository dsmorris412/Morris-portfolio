Telling Stories with Data Public Portfolio

# About me
My name is Deirdre (she/her) and I'm in the Public Policy and Management program here at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm from a small town in Maryland, but have lived in Pittsburgh the last three years. I've worked in law firms up until this shift in trajectory to public policy, so I am trying to make use of every learning opportunity that I come across while in the program. 

# What I hope to learn
Data visualization is incredibly powerful in this day and age, and a tool that is used (not always well) in just about every industry. The strategies and tools will all be new to me (I'm pretty easily impressed by it all right now). I hope to learn how to cater a visualization to a particular audience and how to create honest visualizations that are effective in communication. I plan to narrow this down but after I graduate, I am hoping to go into the policy analysis field.
